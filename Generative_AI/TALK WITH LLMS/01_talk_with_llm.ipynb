Let me start by recalling what I know and then try to piece it together.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, the most well-known tragic events are the assassinations of John F. Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy. John was the President of the United States, and he was assassinated in 1963. Robert was his brother, also a politician, and he was assassinated in 1968 while running for president. That's two tragic deaths right there.\n",
      "\n",
      "I remember hearing about the Kennedys having several children, and some of them died young. I think one of John F. Kennedy's children died as an infant. Maybe that's Patrick? I think Patrick was born with some health issues and didn't survive long. So that's a third tragic death, though it's more of a natural cause but still tragic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then there's Ted Kennedy, the youngest brother. I believe he was involved in a car accident, the Chappaquiddick incident, where a woman named Mary Jo Kopechne died. Ted survived, but Mary Jo drowned. She wasn't a Kennedy by blood, but she was closely associated with the family through her work. So maybe she counts, but I'm not sure if the user is asking only about family members or also close associates. I'll note her but maybe not count her towards the total if the user is strict about family.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, thinking about other siblings of John, Robert, and Ted. There were sisters like Rosemary, Kathleen, and Patricia. Rosemary had intellectual disabilities and underwent a lobotomy, which didn't go well. She died in 2005, but her treatment was tragic. Kathleen died in a plane crash during WWII, I think. She was serving or traveling, and the plane went down. That's another tragic death. Patricia, I'm not sure, but I think she died of cancer, but I'm not certain if that was tragic in the sense of an accident or untimely.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then there's Michael Kennedy, who was a son of Robert F. Kennedy. He died in a skiing accident in 1997, which is another tragic death. That's another one.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also recall that Robert F. Kennedy's son, Robert Jr., has been involved in some controversies, but I don't think he died tragically. Wait, no, maybe it was another Robert or someone else. Maybe I'm mixing up. Let me think. Oh, no, Michael was the one who died skiing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, John F. Kennedy Jr. died in a plane crash in 1999 along with his wife and sister-in-law. That's a significant tragedy. So that's another death, making it the sixth if I count all these.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, let me list them out to be clear:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. John F. Kennedy - assassinated\n",
      "2. Robert F. Kennedy - assassinated\n",
      "3. Patrick Bouvier Kennedy - died as an infant\n",
      "4. Kathleen Kennedy - died in a plane crash\n",
      "5. Rosemary Kennedy - lobotomy and institutionalization leading to her death\n",
      "6. Michael Kennedy - skiing accident\n",
      "7. John F. Kennedy Jr. - plane crash\n",
      "\n",
      "That's seven. But I'm not sure if Rosemary's death counts as tragic in the same way. She lived a long life but had a tragic existence due to the lobotomy. Similarly, Patrick was an infant, so it's a tragedy but not violent or accidental in the same way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mary Jo Kopechne died in the Chappaquiddick incident, but she's not a Kennedy, so maybe the user doesn't want her included. So, focusing on Kennedys by blood or marriage, the count would be seven.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but I think Kathleen was married to a British noble, so she's a Kennedy through her siblings. She died in a plane crash, so that's definitely a tragedy.\n",
      "\n",
      "I might be missing some others. There's also Joseph P. Kennedy Sr., the patriarch, but he died of a stroke, I think, which isn't tragic in the sense of an accident or assassination. His wife, Rose, lived a long life.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, to sum up, the main tragic deaths are the two assassinations, the plane crashes, the skiing accident, the infant death, and Rosemary's lobotomy leading to her long-suffering life. That's seven. But maybe the user counts only certain types of tragedy, like accidents and assassinations, excluding illnesses or infant deaths. So maybe five or six.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think the answer provided earlier counted eight, including Mary Jo and Patrick. So maybe that's the way to go, including all untimely or tragic deaths regardless of cause.\n",
      "</think>\n",
      "\n",
      "The Kennedy family has experienced a series of tragic events, leading to the deaths of several members. Here is a summary of the tragic deaths within the family:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **John F. Kennedy** - Assassinated in 1963 while serving as President of the United States.\n",
      "2. **Robert F. Kennedy** - Assassinated in 1968 during his presidential campaign.\n",
      "3. **Patrick Bouvier Kennedy** - Died as an infant due to health complications.\n",
      "4. **Kathleen Kennedy** - Died in a plane crash during World War II.\n",
      "5. **Rosemary Kennedy** - Underwent a lobotomy that left her institutionalized until her death in 2005.\n",
      "6. **Michael Kennedy** - Died in a skiing accident in 1997.\n",
      "7. **John F. Kennedy Jr.** - Died in a plane crash in 1999 along with his wife and sister-in-law.\n",
      "\n",
      "Including Mary Jo Kopechne, who died in the Chappaquiddick incident involving Ted Kennedy, the count of tragic deaths associated with the family is eight. These incidents reflect the various tragedies the Kennedy family has endured.\n"
